                    <h4>The Social Edge</h4></div>
                <p>
                    TSE was a startup who built some tools to prove they had a place in the market. I came on to upgrade, and architect proper solutions. 
                </p>
                <h5>Astrometrics</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>TSE Process A LOT of third party data, and need well established records of the metrics for billing purposes. Astrometrics is a tool I architected to handle processing, and saving the external information in real time. </li>
                    <li>Built to scale so that the service can grow as the data needs grow</li>
                    <li>Processes the information in real time so changes can be show on the UI layer as they happen. (This is an improvement over the old system)</li>
                    <li>Provides data pipelines provided so that other tools can analyze the data in real time or asynchronously.</li>
                    <li>Increased data retrieval time so that larger sets of data can be processed. </li>
                    <li>Allowed us integrate machine learning services into our stack</li>
                    <li>Saved money by utilizing services that scale better, and for less money. Saving hundreds on hosting costs.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Contempo</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Upgraded a legacy PHP UI to a modern framework. A node/rest api backend, with a standalone React/AltJS frontend</li>
                    <li>Established continuous integration environments for easier environment management and software deploys</li>
                    <li>Successfully launched the tool with complete feature coverage, and enhancements to save employees and customers time. </li>
                </ul>
                <h5>SQL Lessons</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>TSE Sales and Media teams live and die by analyzing the data that is stored in our systems. For the most part we have reports, and tools that provide friendly access to the most important data. However many teams craved more real time, or more in-depth data analysis.</li>
                    <li>I worked with these teams to teach the fundamentals of SQL, and our data storage so that these teams could analyze our data sets outside of reports</li>
                    <li>Some teams used their new SQL knowledge to provide faster, more poignant updates to their teams. While other teams used this knowledge to analyze data to finer degrees, discovering new sales techniques. </li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Process Establishment</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Worked with the engineering team to come up with a process that worked. </li>
                    <li>Implemented a version of scrum, that included focuses on planning as well as development.</li>
                    <li>Provided better team management, requirements elicitation, and communication to upper management as to what is being worked on</li>
